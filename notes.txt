////////// REACT 101, REACT COMPONENTS & PROPS, MANAGING STATE & EVENTS, RENDERING LISTS & STYLING COMPONENTS - WEEK 1 //////////




use "let" when you want to create a variable that is really variable

use "const" when you want to constant variable/value (never changes)

arrow functions solve the problem with the "this" keyword

when importing and exporting (modules) the export "default" keyword marks the default export of said file

use curly braces when importing items by their name {name} and not with the default keyword, use when you must import more than one thing

    import person from "./person.js"

    import {baseData, cleanData} from "./utility.js"

classes are blueprints for objects (JS objects in our case) a class has the "class" keyword, and they can have both properties and methods. Methods are functions attached to classes where properties are variable attached to classes

a class is instantiated with the "new" keyword, classes are a way of creating "contructor" functions

a property is added to a class by adding a "constructor()" the default function/method of a class

properties are set up with the "this" keyword. this.name = "Quinten"

    class Person {
        contructor() {
            this.name = "Quinten";
        }

        printMyName() {
            console.log(this.name);
        }
    }

    const person = new Person();
    person.printMyName();

the spread/rest operator is "..."

spread: is used to split up array elements OR object properties

rest: used to merge a list of function arguments into an array

string, numbers, and booleans are "primitive types" while objects and arrays are "reference types"

What is React? React or ReactJS is a free open source front end JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces based on UI components, maintained by Meta and the community of companies and devs

How to create a new react app? npx create-react-app@latest project/folder name

What is JSX? JSX in React is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax that provides a way to write HTML in React. JSX stands for JavaScript XML and it makes it easier to write and add HTML in React

What is SPA's in React? SPA is a single-page-application, a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript

What is the virtual DOM? React uses virtual DOM to optimize the performance of our application. It provides a mechanism that compares two render trees to know exactly what has changed and only updates what is necessary on the actual DOM

React is an SPA language

App.js and Index.js are going to be our main files when starting/building a React App


Components are re-usuable building blocks in the UI of a page, they are a combination of HTML, CSS, & JS code that make up a page

You build individual components and tell React how to compose them together into the user interface

React allows you to create re-usuable and reactive components consisting of HTML and JS (little CSS)

React code is written in a "Declarative Way" you will define the desires target/end state and then it is Reacts job to figure out which parts of the website need to be added or removed etc

index.js is the first file that is executed when you visit the webpage on for example localhost:3000

Single Page Applications SPA's only have 1 HTML file which is what shows up on the screen at the end

App.js is our root component, meaning all other components will at some point come through the App.js. App.js is rendered directly onto our 1 HTML document

! A component is React is just a JavaScript function !

components and elements in JSX/React need to begin with an uppercase character 'ExpenseItem"

You can replace hard coded data in React/JSX using "{}"

Props or (Properties) are basically attributes for our components

the event handlers or "on" actions like "onClick" want a function passed as a value

when using a function inside an onClick you just point at the function and not call it with () at the end clickHandler() <-- is a no

the function "useState" is provided by the react library that allows us to define values as State where changes to these values should reflect in the component function being called again. useState is a react hook.

useState always returns an array with 2 elements, the first element is the current state value and the second element is a function for updating that

props can only be sent from direct parents to direct childs we cant skip over components

whenever you are using "two way binding" you are working with a controlled component 

.map() -> this method created a new array based on another array, it transforms the elements from the original array. example with .map we can x2 every number in an array, with map you can do something to every item in an array and creates anew array with the transformed data

.map takes a function as an argument, and that function executes for every element in the array

if they ask to "render a JSX block" they mean use "{}"




////////// Project Planning, Hooks, Managing State with useContext & useReducer, API Requests - Week 2 //////////




React Project Planning phases: Wireframes (Visualize/Design), Component Tree, Code Organization (VSCode-public/src/components), CSS Method, Check API (for necessary info), Make the app static for demonstration

We cannot pass props from Child to parent, only parent to child. so we can often pass down a function that receives a parameter, or we can pass down the "set" function
